Acey is a tennis analytics application combining mobile video, wearable sensors, and an AI agent. All Phase 1 design documents are stored in the `docs/` directory:

- `docs/architecture.md` — overall system design
- `docs/requirements.md` — functional and non-functional requirements
- `docs/roadmap.md` — six‑month development plan
- `docs/initial-cost-plan.md` — preliminary budget
- `docs/sensor-prototype-plan.md` — early hardware strategy
- `docs/codebase-architecture.md` — project structure overview
- `docs/phase2-preparation.md` — next steps before acquiring hardware

These documents provide a reference for starting implementation with simulated sensor data.
