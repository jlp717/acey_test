# Phase 2 Preparation

With the high-level design finalized, development can start without purchasing sensors immediately. The solo developer should focus on the following tasks:

1. **Frontend Development**
   - Build the Next.js application using mocked sensor data.
   - Implement pages and components for dashboards and match playback.
   - Integrate voice command features using the Web Speech API.

2. **Backend Development**
   - Create Firebase Functions to process incoming data and provide REST/WebSocket APIs.
   - Use Firestore to store mock match data until real sensors are available.
   - Set up authentication with Firebase Auth and prepare for OAuth integrations.

3. **Simulated Sensor Data**
   - Generate fake IMU and GPS readings to test end-to-end workflows.
   - Prepare scripts that can be replaced later by real sensor streams.

4. **Planning for Hardware Acquisition**
   - Research affordable IMU and GPS modules (e.g., BMI323, u-blox NEO-7).
   - Estimate costs and coordinate purchase once budget allows.

These steps keep development progressing while planning for real sensor integration during Phase 2.
