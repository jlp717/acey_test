## Development Roadmap

| Month | Milestone | Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Sensor research | Scoring matrix and purchase MPU-6050/u-blox NEO-7 |
| 2 | BLE prototype | Communication tests and field testing (50g, 100km/h) |
| 3-4 | YOLO integration | Dataset scraping and analytics pipeline |
| 5 | AI agent prototype | Predictive analytics and full prototype testing |
| 6 | Validation with pro players | 90% shot classification accuracy (5 players) |

### Dependencies
- YOLO integration depends on dataset availability from Months 1-2.

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Sensor delivery delays**: order critical parts from multiple vendors such as DigiKey and Mouser.
- **Dataset licensing issues**: secure agreements with video owners during Month 1 to avoid delays.
